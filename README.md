# towers-of-hanoi

towers of hanoi is a classic problem demonstrating the usefullness of recursion. The object of the puzzle is to move the tower from A to B without overlaping smaller disks with larger ones. See how just a few lines of python can solve the tower of hanoi problem with the trick of recursion!
